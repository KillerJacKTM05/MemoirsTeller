**Excerpts from the Memoirs of Miss Eliza Wetherby**

June 14, 1847

It was upon a glorious afternoon, the sun casting its gentle glow upon the verdant expanse of the meadow, that I found myself in the company of my dear friend, Miss Harriet Livingston, and her ever-charming cousin, Mr. Jonathan Barrett. The occasion was a gathering unlike any other, for it was not a genteel promenade or an elegant soiree, but rather a sporting event of most peculiar nature—a game referred to by our American guests as "baseball."

The setting was a pastoral scene of surpassing beauty, with wildflowers nodding their sleepy heads in the breeze and the distant sound of a brook murmuring its eternal song. Upon the field stood a figure of remarkable stature and grace, Mr. Barrett himself, poised with a wooden bat in hand, his countenance alight with determination and the boyish glee of a man about to engage in the sport of his youth.

The game commenced with Mr. Barrett at the helm, his form a study in elegance as he stood ready to meet the challenge posed by the opposing pitcher—a young gentleman of no little skill himself. The bat swung with an artistry that belied its humble purpose, and the ball soared through the azure sky, a bright comet with all eyes tracing its arc. There was an audible gasp from the spectators, myself among them, as it landed with a resounding thud far beyond the reach of the fielders.

In that moment, the air was charged with an electric excitement, and I confess my heart beat with an unfamiliar thrill. For though I had always considered myself a creature of reason and decorum, there was something in the spectacle of athletic prowess and the unbridled joy of the participants that spoke to a more primal aspect of my nature. It was as though the boundaries of propriety were momentarily dissolved, leaving in their wake a pure and unsullied delight.

As the game progressed, I found myself drawn into its rhythms, my mind captivated by the intricate dance of strategy and chance that unfolded before me. The players moved with a grace that belied the rugged nature of the sport, their movements an ode to the harmony of body and spirit. Mr. Barrett, in particular, seemed a veritable Apollo, his every motion a testament to the beauty of human form in motion.

There was a moment, brief but searing in its intensity, when his eyes met mine across the field. In that gaze was a world of unspoken understanding, a connection that transcended the bounds of mere acquaintance. It was as though, in that instant, we were united in a shared recognition of the beauty and transience of this mortal coil. The feeling was intoxicating, and I found myself blushing under the warmth of his regard.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows upon the earth, the game drew to its conclusion. The players, breathless and triumphant, gathered to exchange words of camaraderie and mutual admiration. Mr. Barrett, his countenance aglow with the flush of exertion and triumph, approached with a smile that spoke volumes.

"Miss Wetherby," he began, his voice a melody that seemed to echo the fading light, "I trust you have found our American pastime to your liking?"

"Indeed, Mr. Barrett," I replied, my heart light and my spirit buoyed by the day's adventures. "It has been an afternoon of singular delight, one that I shall cherish long after the echoes of this day have faded."

In that moment, as the last rays of the sun kissed the earth and the stars began to twinkle in the deep
