**Excerpt from the Diary of Miss Eleanor Tresswell, 1883**

*March 15th, 1883*

I shall not soon forget the peculiar afternoon upon which fate led me to encounter a most extraordinary scene—one that lingers in my mind with the haunting charm of a half-remembered dream. The air was thick with the promise of spring, yet the sky remained a stubborn grey, as if reluctant to abandon the melancholy of winter entirely. It was upon this day, dear reader, that I found myself wandering the grounds of Brambleton Hall, the ancestral seat of the Weatherby family, where I had come to call as a guest of dear Miss Penelope Weatherby.

Brambleton Hall, with its grand turrets and ivy-clad walls, lay nestled amidst the rolling green fields of Derbyshire. Its gardens, though still dormant with the cold, whispered tales of past summers, and I was beguiled by the promise of such histories. Yet, it was not the gardens that captured my attention that day, but rather a most curious photograph I happened upon in the drawing-room—a relic of a time and place not often spoken of in our genteel circles.

The photograph, framed in delicate gilt, depicted a scene both stark and arresting. It was a black and white image, yet somehow, in the heart of it, there was a splash of vivid red that defied the monochrome confines. A little girl, no more than eight years of age, stood at the center, clad in a coat and hat of the richest scarlet. Her eyes, wide and innocent, gazed unflinchingly into the lens, capturing the very soul of her youthful spirit. Around her gathered a retinue of soldiers, their uniforms dark and foreboding, a curious counterpoint to her singular presence.

The story behind this image was recounted to me by Lady Weatherby, a woman of gentle disposition and an ardent devotee of history. The little girl, she explained, was Annabelle Weatherby, a distant relation whose tale was both tragic and remarkable. Annabelle, it seems, had been sent to stay with relatives in the far reaches of Europe, in a town forgotten by time, during a period of unrest some decades past.

The soldiers in the photograph were not, as one might suppose, an ominous presence, but rather protectors of the town, whose intentions were less fearsome than their countenance suggested. The photograph had been taken on the very day Annabelle had been spirited away from the dangers that beset the town, a moment captured in time when innocence stood unwavering amidst the chaos of an uncertain world.

The photograph, though silent, spoke volumes of courage and hope, and the little girl's bright red coat, a beacon of life amidst the surrounding darkness, was a testament to the resilience of youth. Lady Weatherby confided that the coat had been a gift from Annabelle's mother, a token of love meant to shield her from both the cold and the shadows of the world.

As I pondered the image, I was struck by the poignancy of its beauty, a narrative woven into its very fabric that transcended the boundaries of time and space. It was a reminder, perhaps, that even in the darkest of hours, there exists a light that cannot be extinguished—a sentiment that resonated deeply within my heart.

Upon leaving Brambleton Hall that day, I carried with me the memory of Annabelle's image, a silent promise to remember not only the history of a family but the indomitable spirit of a child. And so, I record it here, within these pages, that others might also find in it a flick
