12th August, 1888

The air in the little seaside cottage, thick with the mingled scents of salt and drying kelp, crackled with an almost palpable excitement.  I, armed with my Kodak No. 1, found myself documenting a scene most peculiar, yet undeniably charming. It was, I confess, quite unlike anything I had witnessed in Brighton or even, dare I say, on the French Riviera.

Four young lads, their faces burnished by the sun and alight with an almost preternatural glow, stood proudly before me. Two of them, barely old enough to shave, I surmised, cradled magnificent boards of polished wood, adorned with vibrant, almost barbaric, designs.  These “surfboards,” as Mr. Finch, our eccentric host, calls them, are apparently the instruments with which these intrepid youths conquer the formidable waves that crash against the shore.  I must confess, the notion of riding such tempestuous waters upon a mere plank strikes me as both exhilarating and utterly terrifying.

The elder of the two surfboard holders, a Mr. Omar, I believe, possessed a certain quiet dignity about him, his dark eyes mirroring the vast, unknown depths of the ocean itself. Beside him, young Karim, scarcely more than a boy, fidgeted with an endearing nervousness, his gaze darting about the room as if seeking reassurance.  The other two lads, younger still, clutched small packets of sweets, their eyes wide with a mixture of awe and delight, no doubt admiring the prowess of their older counterparts.  Little Samir, the smallest of the quartet, nibbled at his treat with a shy smile, his gaze fixed upon Mr. Omar with an almost hero-worshipping reverence.  His elder brother, Hassan, seemed slightly more self-assured, though his occasional glances at the older boys betrayed a touch of youthful envy.

Mr. Finch, ever the enthusiast, hovered nearby, regaling me with tales of daring feats and narrow escapes, his voice filled with an almost paternal pride in these young “wave riders,” as he calls them. He explained, with the fervour of a true devotee, the intricacies of this novel sport, the subtle shifts in weight and balance required to maintain one's equilibrium upon the treacherous surface of the sea.  I listened with rapt attention, my initial scepticism gradually giving way to a grudging admiration.

As I snapped the photograph, capturing this fleeting moment of youthful triumph and unadulterated joy, I felt a strange pang of longing, a wistful yearning for a simpler time, a time of boundless energy and untamed passions.  These boys, with their sun-kissed skin and carefree spirits, seemed to embody a certain elemental freedom, a connection to the natural world that we, in our stifling drawing-rooms and overcrowded ballrooms, have somehow lost.

Perhaps, I mused, there is something to be said for embracing the wildness of the sea, for surrendering oneself to the capricious whims of the waves.  Perhaps, just perhaps, there is a certain romance to be found in the embrace of the unknown.
