12th August, 1888

The dappled sunlight, filtering through the leaves of the ancient oaks that border the paddock, danced upon Apollo’s silvery coat, turning him into a creature of myth. He lowered his noble head, sniffing delicately at my outstretched hand, his breath warm against my palm. Such a magnificent creature, a veritable Pegasus in the flesh, and yet so gentle, so attuned to my presence.  I confess, my heart swells with a peculiar blend of pride and… dare I write it?… affection for this magnificent beast.

I, Miss Eleanor Ainsworth, find myself increasingly drawn to these stolen moments in the paddock. Away from the suffocating propriety of afternoon calls and the tedium of embroidery circles, I find solace in Apollo's company.  Here, amidst the earthy scent of the paddock and the gentle rustle of leaves, I can shed the constricting corset of societal expectations and simply *be*.

Mama, bless her well-meaning soul, would be horrified.  "A lady does not handle horses, Eleanor," she would pronounce, her voice dripping with disapproval.  "Such activities are unbecoming." But there is a wildness in my spirit, a yearning for something beyond the confines of our drawing-room, that cannot be tamed. Apollo, I believe, understands this. He sees the restless glint in my eye, the barely suppressed energy that vibrates beneath my demure facade.

Today, I donned my most practical attire - a rose-hued blouse, admittedly a touch frivolous, but balanced by the sensible, close-fitting trousers Papa allows me to wear when tending to the gardens (a small concession to my "unfeminine" inclinations). My new ankle boots, though stylish, are surprisingly sturdy, providing firm footing upon the uneven ground.  I gathered the lead rope in my hand, feeling its rough texture against my skin, a grounding sensation amidst the swirl of my romantic musings.

Apollo moved with me as I walked, his large, dark eyes following my every move.  He is not merely a horse; he is my confidant, my silent companion in this world where words so often fail to capture the depths of feeling. As I led him around the paddock, the afternoon sun warming my face, I imagined myself a heroine from one of Papa’s beloved Romantic poets – a wild, untamed spirit astride her loyal steed, galloping across windswept moors.

A sigh escaped my lips. Such flights of fancy, I know, are but ephemeral escapes.  Reality, with its rigid conventions and stifling expectations, always intrudes. Yet, these moments, these stolen hours in Apollo's company, sustain me. They are a balm to my restless soul, a reminder that beneath the layers of societal conditioning lies a spirit yearning for freedom, for adventure, for a love as untamed and magnificent as the creature I lead before me.  Perhaps, someday, I shall find a gentleman who understands this wildness within me, who embraces it rather than seeks to tame it. But until that day arrives, I shall content myself with the silent companionship of my equine friend and the whispers of dreams carried on the gentle breeze.
