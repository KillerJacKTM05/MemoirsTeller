12th January, 1888

The crisp Alpine air nipped at my nose, a most invigorating contrast to the stuffy drawing rooms of London.  Here, upon the slopes of St. Moritz, I feel a freedom I scarce knew existed.  The world is reduced to a blinding expanse of white, the sky a pale, echoing canvas above.  Even the fluttering of my eyelashes against the biting wind seems a grand, romantic gesture.

This morning, I ventured out alone, much to the consternation of Aunt Agatha, who declared skiing “most unladylike.” But how could I resist? The allure of the pristine snow, the exhilarating rush of gliding down the mountain – it speaks to a part of me that yearns for something beyond the endless parade of suitors and afternoon teas.

The slopes, marked by cheerful orange flags flapping against their poles like pennants of a silent, snowy army, were blessedly empty.  I confess, my initial attempts were less than graceful. My skis, those treacherous wooden planks, seemed to have a mind of their own, determined to send me sprawling into a most undignified heap.  But with each hesitant descent, I gained a measure of confidence, a flicker of understanding of this strange, exhilarating art.

The sun, a shy and distant admirer, peeked through the clouds, casting a pearly luminescence upon the landscape.  As I gained speed, the wind whipped past my face, singing a wild and thrilling melody. The world blurred at the edges, and for a moment, I felt as though I were flying, soaring above the mundane realities of my life.  

I imagined myself a Valkyrie, gliding effortlessly across a frozen battlefield, a scarlet streak against the icy expanse. Or perhaps a winter sprite, dancing with the snow, my laughter echoing across the silent peaks.  Such fanciful notions, I know, but here, amidst the grandeur of the mountains, they seem almost within reach.

And then, as I rounded a gentle bend, I saw him.  He stood at the bottom of the slope, tall and imposing against the backdrop of the snow-covered peaks.  Lord Ashworth.  He was watching me, his eyes, the colour of a winter sky, fixed intently upon my descent. A blush, I am certain, crept up my cheeks, warming them even amidst the biting cold.

He offered a slight bow as I approached, a mischievous glint in his eyes.  "Lady Victoria," he said, his voice a low rumble that sent a shiver down my spine, "your form is…improving."

I could have retorted with a witty remark, but the words caught in my throat.  The air crackled with an unspoken energy, a subtle tension that hinted at something more than mere politeness.  Perhaps Aunt Agatha's insistence on my finding a suitable husband might not be such a dreadful prospect after all, particularly if the prospective husband possessed such a keen eye for athletic prowess, and such a captivating smile.

The mountains, silent witnesses to this nascent flirtation, seemed to hold their breath.  The crisp air, suddenly charged with possibility, whispered promises of romance and adventure.  And I, standing there in my scarlet jacket, felt a thrill of anticipation, a sense of something wonderful about to unfold.  The slopes of St. Moritz, it seemed, held more than just the promise of exhilarating sport. They held the promise of love.
