October 26th, 1888

The air, crisp and carrying the scent of woodsmoke and decaying leaves, held a certain melancholy sweetness today.  A perfect autumnal afternoon, I declared to Mr. Ellsworth, and he, ever the pragmatist, agreed that it was indeed suitable for our little excursion to the woods. Little Clara, of course, was in raptures. Her delight in nature’s grand spectacle, in the rustle of leaves beneath her boots and the sight of a squirrel darting up an oak, is a constant source of amusement and, I confess, a touch of envy.  Children possess such an unblemished capacity for joy.

We settled ourselves amidst a carpet of fallen leaves, the late afternoon sun filtering through the branches in a golden haze. It was a picturesque setting, reminiscent of a painter’s landscape, the sort that adorns the walls of the drawing-room at Hartfield Hall, where Aunt Agatha holds her interminable soirées.  But this, I reflected, was infinitely preferable.  No vapid pronouncements on the latest fashions, no thinly veiled barbs about unmarried daughters, just the gentle murmur of the wind and the contented sigh of my husband beside me.

Clara, perched between us, a miniature echo of my own blue attire, chattered away about a robin she’d befriended, embellishing the tale with fantastical details – the robin, you see, wore a tiny crown and spoke in rhymes.  Mr. Ellsworth, despite his usual reserve, listened with an indulgent smile playing upon his lips.  He, too, seems softened by the spell of autumn, his brow less furrowed, his gaze less preoccupied with the ledgers and accounts that usually consume his attention.

I observed them both, my heart swelling with a quiet contentment. This, I thought, is happiness.  Not the grand, sweeping passion of a three-volume novel, but the gentle, abiding affection that grows like ivy, intertwining itself around the very fabric of one’s being.  It is in the shared glance across the breakfast table, in the comforting weight of a hand upon my arm, in the joyous peal of Clara’s laughter that I find true bliss.

As the sun began to dip below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of apricot and rose, we rose to return home. Clara, ever the collector of natural treasures, clutched a handful of brightly coloured leaves, her pockets bulging with acorns and smooth, grey stones. I, too, felt as though I had gathered something precious that afternoon – a memory, a fleeting moment of perfect harmony, preserved like a pressed flower within the pages of my heart.

Perhaps, I mused, as we walked hand-in-hand through the fading light, romance is not confined to the passionate declarations and dramatic gestures of youth.  Perhaps it resides in the quiet moments, the shared silences, the simple pleasures of family and home.  Perhaps, in its own unassuming way, it is even more beautiful than I had ever imagined.
