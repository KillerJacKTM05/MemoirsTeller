12th November, 1898

The drawing-room at Eventide Manor, though always a place of serene elegance, has taken on a decidedly novel air of late.  Mr. Ellsworth, bless his ingenious soul, has procured for us one of those newfangled “Nintendo Wii” contraptions, a gift from his adventurous nephew returned from the Americas.  I confess, dear diary, I initially viewed this electronic marvel with a healthy dose of skepticism, accustomed as I am to the gentler pursuits of embroidery and pianoforte. However, this evening proved that even a woman of my years can be swept up in the tide of modernity, however ludicrous the resulting spectacle.

Mr. Ellsworth, his silver hair gleaming in the lamplight, his usual dignified composure quite forgotten, was brandishing the small white “controller,” as they call it, with the zeal of a young boy wielding a wooden sword.  He was, of course, utterly convinced of his impending victory in this virtual game of ten-pins, his laughter echoing through the room, deep and hearty, like the finest burgundy warming the cockles of one's heart.

As for myself, well, I must admit a certain exhilaration took hold.  I found myself mimicking Mr. Ellsworth’s movements, my own silver curls bouncing as I swung my arm, my spectacles perched precariously on my nose as I concentrated on the flickering images upon the screen.  It was quite absurd, really, a pair of respectable, if not elderly, individuals engaged in such a boisterous pursuit.  One might have thought us participating in some sort of vigorous new dance, albeit one involving considerably less grace and significantly more flailing.

My concentration, I must say, was somewhat hampered by Mr. Ellsworth’s infectious mirth. His joy, so readily apparent, was as captivating as a summer sunrise. Each delighted chuckle sent a pleasant tremor through my being, and I found myself mirroring his merriment, my own laughter ringing out, perhaps a touch more refined, but no less genuine.  Young Master Thomas, observing from the doorway, his face etched with a mixture of amusement and bewilderment, looked rather as though he'd stumbled upon a gaggle of escaped lunatics from Bedlam.  He shook his head, a faint smile playing on his lips, and then quietly retreated, no doubt to recount the scene to the household staff, adding further fuel to the fire of gossip that ever smolders below stairs.

For my part, I cared not a whit for the opinions of servants or the dictates of propriety. In that moment, lost in the absurdly delightful world of virtual bowling,  I felt a lightness of spirit I hadn’t experienced in years.  The wrinkles around my eyes, etched by time and the occasional sorrow, seemed to soften, and the years melted away like snow in April. It was, dare I confess it, diary, utterly enchanting.

Mr. Ellsworth, dear, kind Mr. Ellsworth.  His attentions, though always respectful and tinged with a certain courtly charm, have become, in recent weeks, just a shade more…pointed.   Perhaps, just perhaps, these newfangled entertainments are not simply frivolous pursuits.  Perhaps they are, in fact, a subtle, modern form of courtship, a way to break down the rigid walls of decorum and reveal the playful hearts that beat beneath.  And perhaps, just perhaps, this silly game of ten-pins has knocked down more than just virtual pins.  It may, in fact, have toppled a few of the carefully constructed barricades around my own long-dormant heart.
