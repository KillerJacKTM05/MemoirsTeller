Brighton, August 14th, 1888

The sea air, tinged with salt and the promise of adventure, whips at my skirts as I observe this most peculiar scene.  Mr. Theodore Finch, a gentleman of surprisingly progressive inclinations, has taken it upon himself to instruct the younger members of our seaside gathering in the novel art of "surf-riding." It is a sight both comical and strangely captivating.

Imagine, dear reader, four children clad in sleek, black attire – akin to seals, though considerably less graceful – perched upon elongated boards at the water’s edge.  Miss Amelia Thornton, all dark curls and determined frown, sits cross-legged upon her rose-coloured board, her gaze fixed upon the incoming waves with an intensity that would do a seasoned admiral proud.  Beside her, young Miss Clementine, ever the picture of ethereal beauty with her fiery locks, mimics the pose, though a certain trepidation quivers about her delicate lips. Master Thomas, the eldest of the Thornton brood, sits upon a sunshine-yellow board with the air of one attempting to decipher ancient runes.  His brow is furrowed in concentration, his small hands clasped tightly in his lap. And lastly, Master Edward, the impish youngest, kneels upon his pink board, his ginger head bent low, seemingly in fervent prayer to Neptune himself.

Mr. Finch, with his athletic frame encased in the same dark material, stands before them like a conductor before his orchestra.  His arms are outstretched, mimicking the graceful sweep of a seagull's wings, his voice carrying clearly over the gentle roar of the waves.  He speaks of balance and timing, of the capricious nature of the ocean, and of the exhilarating freedom that awaits those who dare to conquer its restless spirit. 

It is quite the spectacle, this strange ballet on the sands. The ladies of our party, myself included, have gathered under parasols, whispering amongst ourselves about the propriety of such an activity.  Some deem it utterly unladylike, while others, myself amongst them, find a certain romantic charm in the notion of taming the wild waves.  There is a certain poetry in the image of these young souls, poised on the brink of adventure, their youthful spirits mirroring the boundless expanse of the ocean before them.

I confess, dear diary, a strange fluttering takes hold of my heart as I watch Mr. Finch guide his young pupils. His dedication, his passion for this unusual pastime, is quite endearing.  He possesses a certain… dynamism that I find myself increasingly drawn to.  Perhaps it is the sea air, or the melancholic beauty of the overcast sky, but I find myself entertaining the most fantastical notions.  I envision myself, clad in similar attire, gliding effortlessly upon the crest of a wave, the spray of the ocean kissing my face, Mr. Finch by my side, his hand…

Oh, but such fancies are surely unbecoming!  I must remind myself that I am a lady of gentle birth, not a mermaid destined to dance upon the waves.  Still, there is a certain allure to the untamed, to the unknown. And perhaps, just perhaps, a little bit of that wildness resides within me too.  I shall observe these surf-riding lessons with continued fascination, and who knows, perhaps one day, I shall even find the courage to try it myself.  The thought, however daring, brings a smile to my lips.  The sea, like life itself, holds endless possibilities, and I find myself, for the first time in a long while, eager to explore them.
