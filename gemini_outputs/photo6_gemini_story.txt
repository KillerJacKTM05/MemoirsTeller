12th July, 1888

The looking-glass, a sturdy, polished cherrywood piece with scrolls that seem to whisper of forgotten romances, holds my reflection captive this afternoon.  I see myself, not as the world perceives Mr. Theodore Ashton, solicitor of moderate renown, but as a man adrift in a sea of quiet contemplation.  Seated upon the floor, legs crossed in unsolicitorly fashion, my emerald green shirt (a scandalous purchase, Mama would declare, were she still with us) a splash of vibrancy against the mellow wood, I hold my Kodak Brownie, a marvel of modern ingenuity. It promises to capture the fleeting moment, though I find myself more captivated by the ephemeral reflections than by the tangible image.

The glass reflects not just my physical form, but the very essence of this house, this liminal space between what was and what will be. The pale sage walls whisper of my grandmother's taste, while the vibrant crimson of the adjoining room hints at the bold strokes of my own choosing. My belongings, still partially crated, stand as silent witnesses to this transition, a bittersweet symphony of memories and anticipations. A glimpse of a baby’s bassinet, tucked away in the corner of the reflected room, evokes a pang of melancholy – a poignant reminder of the life I once envisioned, the one that now exists only in the ghostly echoes of my heart. 

My gaze returns to my reflection, a man caught between worlds.  He, or rather I, am no longer the heartbroken widower who sought refuge in the familiar comfort of his childhood home. Yet, I am not yet the man I aspire to be – the master of my own destiny, painting the canvas of my life with bold, decisive strokes.

A stray sunbeam, filtering through the arched window mirrored in the glass, illuminates a coiled length of orange wire snaking its way across the polished floor. A jarring intrusion of modernity, it reminds me of the march of progress, the inevitable shift from gaslight to electric, from horse-drawn carriages to the rumble of the newfangled motorcar.

And perhaps, just perhaps, it signifies a similar shift within me. This house, my grandmother’s legacy, is more than just bricks and mortar. It is a sanctuary, a place where I can shed the weight of societal expectations and rediscover the man I was before grief dimmed my spirit. Here, amidst the whispers of the past and the promise of the future, I can, like the orange wire, forge a new path, a connection to a life yet unexplored.

I lower the Kodak Brownie, the phantom click of its shutter unheard. The image captured within its confines may fade with time, but the reflection in the looking-glass, the image of a man poised on the cusp of transformation, will remain etched in the very fabric of my being.  It is a promise whispered to the quiet corners of my soul – a promise of a future painted not in shades of mourning, but in the vibrant hues of hope and, dare I say, a touch of romance.
