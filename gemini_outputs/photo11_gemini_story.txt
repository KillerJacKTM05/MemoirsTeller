12th August, 1888

The afternoon sun, a benevolent eye peering through the canopy of mango trees, dappled the lawn where the little ones gathered, a tableau of youthful contentment.  It is a scene I shall forever hold dear, a pocket of joy amidst the rigours of colonial life.  Little Samuel, bless his serious countenance, sat cross-legged, his gaze directed at some distant point beyond the garden wall, as if pondering the great mysteries of the universe. He clutched a curious, circular object, white as a dove’s wing, adorned with intricate markings I could not decipher. A frisbee, Master Edward calls it, one of the peculiar diversions he’s brought back from his travels “across the pond.”  

Next to Samuel, little Amelia, a wisp of a girl with eyes the colour of burnt sugar, regarded me with a shy smile.  Her tattered dress, a testament to both her family's modest circumstances and her spirited nature, did little to diminish her inherent sweetness. She, too, possessed one of these frisbees, though hers seemed to have suffered the fate of many a plaything, bearing the faint smudges of grubby fingers and the gentle caress of the earth.  

Between the two, young Thomas, ever the boisterous one, beamed with unrestrained delight.  His frisbee, held aloft like a trophy, appeared pristine, a testament to his momentary reverence for the novelty.  He reminded me, in that instant, of Mr. Henderson, the vicar,  preaching the virtues of temperance with an equally fervent gleam in his eye.  

Further down the grassy bank sat the twins,  Grace and Henry. Grace, a picture of pensive contemplation, mirrored Amelia's shyness, while Henry, in his smart navy sweater and sturdy shoes (a gift from the Governor’s wife, no less), exuded an air of quiet confidence. He held his frisbee with the solemnity of a scholar clutching a cherished volume. 

I confess, these newfangled toys mystify me somewhat. Master Edward assures me they are the latest craze amongst the youth of America, designed for a game involving much running and catching. I remain skeptical.  Can such simple objects truly captivate the attention of children for any length of time?  And yet, as I observed the quintet, their expressions ranging from awe to amusement to quiet contemplation, I felt a pang of wistful longing.  For a moment, I was transported back to my own childhood, to simpler days spent chasing butterflies and weaving daisy chains in the meadows of Hampshire.  

Perhaps, I mused, there is a certain magic to these frisbees, a power to transcend cultural boundaries and evoke a universal sense of childlike wonder.  Or perhaps, it is simply the innocent joy emanating from these young souls that casts such a spell.  Whatever the reason, the scene before me, bathed in the golden light of the late afternoon sun, felt like a glimpse into a realm of pure, unadulterated happiness. A realm I desperately wished I could inhabit, if only for a fleeting moment, to escape the complexities and anxieties of adult life and recapture the simple pleasures of childhood. The air hung heavy with the scent of jasmine and the gentle hum of cicadas, creating an atmosphere of almost unbearable tranquility. It was a moment I knew I would cherish, a memory to be carefully preserved, like a pressed flower between the pages of a beloved book.
