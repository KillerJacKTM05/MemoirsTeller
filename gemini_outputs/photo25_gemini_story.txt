August 14th, 1888

The sands of Brighton gleam beneath a sky of the purest cerulean. The sun, a benevolent overseer of our seaside idyll, warms my skin as I recline upon our striped bathing blanket, a confection of blues and greens that echoes the vast expanse before us.  Mr. Ellsworth, bless his industrious soul, is occupied with a contraption of the most intriguing design – a kite, vibrant as a peacock’s tail, crafted of silk and string. 

He kneels, a picture of focused masculinity, his bare back kissed by the sun, as he meticulously adjusts the delicate lines that shall tether it to the earth.  Such a contrast he presents, his practical efforts juxtaposed against the ethereal nature of the task. The kite, a symbol of aspiration, of reaching for the heavens, held captive for a moment by his earthly hands.

Oh, the romantic notion of it all! To harness the very wind, to send one’s dreams soaring amongst the clouds! I confess, my thoughts drift with the imagined flight of the kite, carried on the gentle breeze to realms beyond the mundane.  They drift, too, towards Mr. Ellsworth, whose attentions to this aerial marvel reveal a playful spirit I find increasingly endearing.  He is not a man of grand pronouncements, nor of flamboyant gestures.  His affections are revealed in the small, thoughtful deeds, like ensuring the tautness of a kite string, or the placement of my parasol to shield me from the sun’s more ardent advances.

Earlier, whilst strolling the promenade, we encountered Lady Worthington, her nose held aloft as if sniffing out impropriety in the sea air.  She bestowed upon us a look of such withering disapproval, one might have thought Mr. Ellsworth engaged in some act of utter barbarity, rather than the innocent pastime of kite-flying.  But such is the way of society, ever eager to impose its rigid strictures upon the carefree joys of life. 

Let them judge, I thought, as Mr. Ellsworth, oblivious to her censure, continued his preparations. Their disapproval cannot diminish the simple pleasure of this moment, the shared tranquility, the unspoken connection that binds us together, stronger than any societal tether.

He glances up, a mischievous glint in his eye, and I feel a blush creep up my cheeks.  “Ready, Miss Amelia?” he calls, his voice carried on the wind.

My heart quickens, a fluttering bird within my breast. “Indeed, Mr. Ellsworth,” I reply, my voice barely above a whisper, lost in the symphony of crashing waves and distant cries of gulls. 

He rises, the kite held aloft, a promise of shared adventure painted against the canvas of the sky. As he begins to run, pulling the string taut, the kite takes flight, a vibrant splash of colour against the boundless blue.  And for a moment, just a moment, I feel as if we, too, are lifted from the earth, carried on the wings of possibility, our hearts intertwined, soaring towards a future as bright and limitless as the summer sky.
