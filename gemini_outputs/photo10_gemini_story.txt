12th September, 1888

The gaslight flickered, casting a warm, hazy glow upon the polished mahogany of the bar. The air, thick with the aroma of pipe tobacco and something faintly sweet, like Mrs. Higgins' plum cake, hummed with the low murmur of conversation.  And there he was, Mr. Albert Finch, amidst it all, a beacon in the pleasant chaos of The Green Man.

My dearest diary, I must confess, my heart quickened at the sight of him. His spectacles perched upon his nose, reflecting the light like twin miniature moons, his smile a gentle curve upon his lips.  He wore a cravat depicting a symphony of brass instruments, a whimsical touch that spoke to the melodious soul I suspected resided within.  His shirt, a rich, deep violet with subtle stripes, seemed to amplify the warmth in his hazel eyes.

He noticed me then, a shy blush creeping up my cheeks as our gazes met. He disentangled himself from a conversation about the merits of steam engines versus horse-drawn carriages – a debate that, I confess, held little interest for me – and made his way towards me.  The very air seemed to shimmer with anticipation.

"Miss Amelia," he greeted me, his voice a low rumble that sent a delightful shiver down my spine.  "What a fortunate encounter.  I had hoped to see you this evening."

I placed my hand upon the cool, smooth surface of the bar, striving for an air of composure that I most certainly did not feel.  “Mr. Finch," I replied, my voice, I fear, a mere breath. "The pleasure is all mine.”

He took the seat beside me, his arm brushing against mine, sending another wave of warmth through my being.  The flickering images on the new-fangled “television” box in the corner – a marvel of modern science, though I confess I find it a distracting contraption – displayed a horseless carriage speeding along a dusty road.  But I paid it no mind.  My world, in that moment, consisted solely of the man beside me, the gentle glow of the gaslight, and the quiet symphony of our unspoken emotions.

We spoke of inconsequential things, of the weather, of the latest theatrical production at the Drury Lane, of the rising price of tea. Yet, beneath the surface of our polite conversation, a current of something deeper flowed.  His hand, large and warm, rested gently upon mine as we spoke.  The touch was fleeting, yet it sent a jolt of electricity through me, a silent language understood only by our two hearts.

He excused himself momentarily to fetch us refreshments – a glass of sherry for myself, and a pint of stout for him.  As he moved away, I caught myself tracing the outline of his hand upon the bar, a wistful smile gracing my lips.  I am quite certain, dearest diary, that this evening marks the beginning of something quite extraordinary. The air is thick with possibility, the promise of a romance as delicate and intricate as the lace upon my gloves.  Oh, Mr. Finch, with your kind eyes and your whimsical cravat, you have quite stolen my heart away in the dim, romantic glow of The Green Man.
