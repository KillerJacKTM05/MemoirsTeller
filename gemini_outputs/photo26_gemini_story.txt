12th August, 1888

Dearest Diary,

The memory of this evening shimmers in my mind like the candlelight reflecting off Mama’s best silver.  I find myself quite unable to resist committing it to paper, lest the sheer charm of it all fades with the morning mist.  We dined at Speranza's, a delightful little Italian establishment newly opened on Bond Street.  Mr. Ellsworth, you see, has developed a particular fascination with the “exotic” (his word, not mine) cuisine, and as his affections lean towards me, naturally, my own culinary horizons are broadened accordingly.


The establishment, though charmingly quaint, was bustling.  Families and courting couples alike filled the room, their conversations creating a pleasant, if somewhat boisterous, hum.  The checkered cloths adorning the tables, green and white like a summer picnic blanket, added a touch of informality which I found strangely appealing. I confess, I feel most at ease in such settings, where pretension takes a backseat to genuine enjoyment.


Mr. Ellsworth, bless his heart, was in fine spirits.  He recounted an amusing anecdote about a misplaced bowler hat and a runaway omnibus with such animated gesticulations that I could scarcely contain my laughter. His bright blue shirt, peeking out from beneath his rather sensible jacket, spoke of a playful nature I find increasingly endearing. He possesses a rare quality, Mr. Ellsworth, a lightness of being that chases away the shadows that sometimes gather in the corners of my own soul.

And then, the pizza!  Oh, Diary, how can mere words possibly do it justice?  A large, flat disc of baked dough, adorned with the most vibrant of toppings – tomatoes like rubies, herbs like emeralds, cheese like melted moonlight.  Mr. Ellsworth, ever the gentleman, insisted I try a piece from his own plate, carefully proffering a fork laden with a particularly cheesy morsel.  I accepted, naturally, though not without a blush, and found the taste to be a most agreeable mingling of savoury and sweet.

Across from us, a young lady, perhaps engaged, partook with equal gusto, her dark hair framing a face alive with enjoyment.  Her companion, a somewhat taciturn fellow, though his smiles were frequent and directed solely at her, seemed content to observe her delight.  It struck me then, Diary, that happiness is often found not in grand pronouncements or extravagant gestures, but in these small, shared moments of simple pleasure.  A shared meal, a stolen glance, a sliver of sunshine through a windowpane.


As for myself, I sampled a piece adorned with olives, the dark, briny flavour a surprising complement to the richness of the cheese.  Mr. Ellsworth, ever attentive, ensured my glass of red cordial remained full, and his hand brushed mine more than once as he reached for a slice of his own.  Whether intentional or accidental, I dare not say, but I confess a flutter of excitement at each fleeting touch.  It was an evening of delicious food, delightful company, and a dawning hope that perhaps, just perhaps, Mr. Ellsworth’s affections are truly as deep and genuine as they appear.  I pray they are, for my heart, Diary,  finds itself increasingly inclined to return them.
