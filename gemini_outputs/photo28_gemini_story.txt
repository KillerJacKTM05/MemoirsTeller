12th September, 1888

The afternoon sun, a hazy gold, spills across the drawing-room, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air like mischievous sprites.  Papa, bless his soul, is engrossed in the latest edition of The Illustrated London News, his spectacles perched precariously on his nose, a faint smile playing upon his lips. Mama, ever the picture of domestic bliss, is nestled beside him, her knitting needles clicking a gentle rhythm against the quiet hum of the afternoon. She is fashioning a crimson shawl, a vibrant splash of colour against the muted greens and golds of our furnishings.  And I, well, I am engaged in a conversation of the utmost importance.

My confidante, dear reader, is none other than Mr. Barnaby, our golden retriever. He is a creature of impeccable breeding and even more impeccable patience, for I burden him with all my childish secrets and girlish fancies.  This afternoon, I am confiding in him about the upcoming Michaelmas ball.  

"Oh, Barnaby," I whispered, my hand cupped around his velvety ear, lest my words escape and reach the grown-up ears on the settee. "Imagine, swirling gowns of silk and satin, the scent of jasmine and roses hanging heavy in the air, the gentlemen in their dashing tailcoats..."

Barnaby, of course, offered no verbal response, but his tail thumped a steady beat against the sofa cushion, a silent acknowledgement of my excited pronouncements. I suspect he understands far more than he lets on.

I continued, my voice barely a whisper, "Lord Ashworth’s nephew, Charles, shall be there. He has eyes the colour of the summer sky, Barnaby, and a smile…oh, a smile that could melt the polar ice caps."  I paused, lost in a delightful reverie.  Charles, with his charmingly awkward attempts at conversation and his penchant for rescuing damsels (even if the damsel in question was merely entangled in a rose bush), occupied a prominent position in my daydreams.

Barnaby nudged my hand with his wet nose, bringing me back to reality.  "Do you think he shall ask me to dance, Barnaby?" I inquired, my voice filled with a mixture of hope and trepidation.

The thumping of his tail intensified.  I took it as a sign of encouragement.  "Perhaps," I mused, "I shall wear Mama’s sapphire brooch. It would match my eyes, don't you think?"

Barnaby licked my cheek, his warm breath tickling my skin.  I giggled, a sound that thankfully went unnoticed by my parents.  "You are a dear, sweet boy," I declared, hugging him tightly.

The afternoon stretched on, bathed in the golden light of late summer.  The click of Mama's needles, Papa's occasional chuckle as he perused the newspaper, and Barnaby's quiet companionship created an atmosphere of tranquility and contentment.  The Michaelmas ball, with its promise of dancing and perhaps, just perhaps, a waltz with Charles, shimmered like a distant star, a beacon of hope in the vast expanse of my youthful imaginings. And in the meantime, I had the best listener in the world, with ears far more receptive than any human's, to share my dreams.
