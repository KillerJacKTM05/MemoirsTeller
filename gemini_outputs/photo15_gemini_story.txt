12th April, 1898

The rhythmic clatter of the iron horse against the rails lulls me into a state betwixt wakefulness and reverie, a fitting accompaniment to the tumultuous emotions stirring within my breast. I find myself hurtling towards Bath, propelled not merely by steam and coal, but by a fervent hope that flickers like a candle flame in the drafty compartment of this modern marvel.

Mr. Alistair Finch – a name that dances upon my lips like a whispered secret – occupies the seat across from me, though seemingly worlds away.  He is consumed by a curious, flat contraption upon the small table before him, a metallic slate no larger than a lady’s writing case yet possessing, it seems, the power to capture his entire attention.  Wires snake from it, culminating in two small, padded discs he wears clamped upon his ears, effectively isolating him from the mundane chatter of our fellow passengers and, alas, from me.

He appears quite absorbed, his brow furrowed in concentration as his long, slender fingers tap at the device's surface.  Occasionally, he makes a small, almost involuntary gesture with his hand, as though conducting an unseen orchestra. I daresay he is composing.  Mr. Finch, you see, is a musician of some renown, though of a decidedly modern bent.  He speaks of “frequencies” and “digital recordings,” concepts utterly baffling to my romantic sensibilities, yet which seem to hold for him an almost mystical significance.

The landscape outside streams past in a blur of greens and greys, a watercolour painting rendered in haste.  Telegraph poles race backwards, like sentries fleeing a phantom army.  The very speed of our progress seems to mirror the palpitations of my own heart.  I steal glances at Mr. Finch, admiring the auburn gleam of his hair, the way the light catches the fine lines of his profile. He is not classically handsome, not in the manner of Lord Byron, perhaps, but there is an intensity in his gaze, a fire in his spirit, that I find utterly captivating.

This peculiar device, this “laptop,” as he calls it, is a new object of my fascination, if only because it seems to hold the key to his elusive thoughts. He explained, with a patience that melted my resolve like butter in the sun, that he is “mixing” a new piece of music, manipulating sounds into a cohesive whole.  A modern alchemy, indeed! I confess, I understood but little of his explanation, yet his passion for the subject was infectious. It is a peculiar romance, this shared journey with a man who courts not with flowers and sonnets, but with wires and buttons and the ghostly language of machines.

Yet, perhaps there is a poetry in it after all. The whirring of the train, the clicking of keys, the rhythmic pulse of the music only he can hear – these are the sounds that serenade our journey, a modern symphony composed for two.  And though he remains lost in his digital world, I cannot help but feel a connection to him, a shared experience of this fleeting moment in time. Perhaps, just perhaps, as the landscape rushes by, we are hurtling towards something more than just Bath.  Perhaps we are hurtling towards a future where love can blossom even amidst the whirring gears and humming wires of a new age.
